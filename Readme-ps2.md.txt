\section{PS2: Pentaflake}

I investigated the intriguing field of fractals in this research, concentrating on the Pentaflake. This job entailed creating a visually appealing depiction of the Pentaflake, a complex pattern generated by drawing pentagons recursively, using the SFML package. To create this complex fractal design, the project required me to comprehend and apply the ideas of recursion and geometric transformations.

The Pentaflake project relied significantly on geometric calculations and recursion. I drew and positioned each pentagon precisely to create the larger fractal design using recursive methods. Vectors were the primary data structures utilized, holding the coordinates and transformation matrices for every pentagon. This project was essential to my comprehension of the use of recursion in the creation of intricate geometric designs.

I now have a better understanding of recursion and how to use it in graphical programming thanks to this project. I gained knowledge on how to use SFML to edit forms and perform geometric transformations to produce complex patterns. My mathematics abilities were also enhanced by this project, especially in terms of comprehending and using geometry and trigonometry ideas in a programming setting.

Difficulty: Drawing the pentaflake in the CPP was the only significant challenge I faced, but after a few attempts, I was able to master it.

Errors : I only had errors with lint, which where alot
